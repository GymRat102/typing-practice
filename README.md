## Goal

To be a better programmer, typing speed training is a must, not a thing nice to have. Even generally, proficiency in typing will boost your efficiency of using your machine.

It's worth noting that the motive of this exercise is to prepare myself to learn Vim.

Each time, I do a 20-minute practice and use a Shortcut on my Mac to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow in this repo (kudos to @yihong0618 for [his instruction](https://github.com/yihong0618/gitblog/issues/198) on how to set it up), which simply log the date and a short note from my input into the table below.

The website I use to practice is [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.game) and [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect.
